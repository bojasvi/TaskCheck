# TaskCheck
A minimalistic productivity focused Android App that allows you to create and organize your daily tasks.

The app uses a `RecyclerView` to display the list of tasks to the user. When the user first opens the 
app, a snackbar intro is displayed about how to mark a task as completed. The rest of the UI
is extremely intuitive and can be grasped at the first look. SharedPreferences are currently being
used to persist the task list on storage (database version currently in development).
